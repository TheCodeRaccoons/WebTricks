	    WebTricks aims to create easy-to-implement, reusable functionalities for the web. The main platform this project was built for at the beginning was <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>, but most of the scripts are made to work on any web development project. Meaning that most of the scripts should work without an issue on any website unless it is a CMS  ONLY functionality or a Webflow-Specific script.

<h2 id="about">About the Project</h2>
<p>
	As any other developer using no-code web design tools I've struggled with the ability to bring specific, more complex functionalities to platforms like Webflow.
	<br/><br/>
	Over the past couple of years I started noticing some of this functionalities are not only commonly used but also requested by many in the community. WebTricks aims to empower developers and designers alike, provinding both simple and complex functionalities that could, in other cases, take longer to develop from scratch.
	<br/><br/>
    Webtricks is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to extend and overcome the limitations of no-code platforms like Webflow. It provides a collection of scripts that solve common challenges faced by developers and designers, offering enhanced functionality, dynamic interactions, and streamlined workflows without heavy dependencies.
    <br/><br/>
	This being said even though most of this functionalities are built for Webflow, there's many that can be used in any other web project and platform. Feel free to see the full <a href="https://coderacoons.webflow.io/webtricks">documentation</a> in my site for the complete list of functionalities and scripts available.
</p>
<sub>
   WebTricks might have been started as a personal project, but I'm a believer that a project for the comunity by the comunity can offer way more value than any single dev could provide so feel free to contribute to this project and use any solution here.

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
Direct Import via jsDelivr: Webtricks is hosted on jsDelivr, making it simple to include in your project. You can import individual functionalities directly into your HTML file. For example:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TheCodeRaccoons/WebTricks@1/Dist/Functional/ReadTime.min.js"></script>
```
Replace CountUp.min.js with the specific script you want to include.

Multiple Scripts: Add as many scripts as you need to your project by referencing their respective paths. Example:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TheCodeRaccoons/webtricks@1/dist/Functional/CMSFilter.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TheCodeRaccoons/webtricks@1/dist/Functional/FormCheck.min.js"></script>
```
Ready to Use: Once imported, the scripts initialize automatically, provided the correct HTML attributes are in place.
